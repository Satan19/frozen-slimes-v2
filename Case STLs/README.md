### Cases

There are a few diffrent cases that have been created. 

I made the two that are listed below but you can also find a variety of other cases and extensions in the #community-cases channel in the discord. 



#V2.1 Snap Case
This case is designed to printed easily. The two halves just snap over the pcb.

This is still in testing and can be found in the discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/1032474370628653137/1032474371257810986/1186046022753992724)




#V2 Case
This is the original case that I created for the project but some people have trouble printing it and putting it together. 

CAD [here](https://a360.co/42u5nMa).

There are some varisous versions of the cases:

**Electronics Cover** - This is the part that slides over the top of the tracker to protect the electronics
- [ ] ECover.stl (This option has the switch soldered to the switch pads)  
- [ ] ECoverTopSwitch.stl (This option has the switch mounted on the top of the tracker)  

<br />

**Bottom Cover** - This is the part that hooks under the tracker to protect the connections
- [ ] BottomCover.stl (This is the standard choice, use it if you are directly soldering the switch on)  
- [ ] BottomCoverThick.stl (This is a thicker version of the one above, its more rigid but the trackers are bigger)
<br />

- [ ] BottomCoverTopSwitch.stl (Use this if you are mounitng the switch on top of the tracker, if you are using the ECoverTopSwitch.stl)  
- [ ] BottomCoverTopSwitchThick.stl (This is a thicker version of the one above, its more rigid but the trackers are bigger)  

<br />



To install the top cover remove the battery holder and slide it on from the battery side of the pcb to the imu side of the case, resolder on the battery holder.

### Printing

Print in this orientation with NO SUPPORTS. 
20% infill is good.
